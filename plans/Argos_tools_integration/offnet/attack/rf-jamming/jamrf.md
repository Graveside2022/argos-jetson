## Tool Description

JamRF is a Python/GNU Radio-based SDR jamming tool by the Technology Innovation Institute (TIIUAE). It implements multiple jamming modes including proactive and reactive jamming with single-tone, swept-sine, and Gaussian noise waveforms. Includes two main scripts: jamRF_v1.py (core jamming modes) and jamRF_v2.py (extended with QPSK modulation, energy-saving features, and memory optimization). Uses YAML configuration files for jammer parameters. The repository also includes HackRF-specific implementations, MATLAB simulation code, and analysis tools. Python 56.6%, MATLAB 39.6%, Shell 3.8%.

## Docker Compatibility Analysis

### Can it run in Docker?

**YES** - Python/GNU Radio-based tool that runs in Docker with HackRF One USB passthrough. No GUI dependency for core jamming functionality.

### Host OS-Level Requirements

- `--privileged` - Required for raw USB device access to HackRF One for RF transmission
- `--device=/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb` - USB passthrough for HackRF One hardware
- No `--net=host` required (operates via USB to HackRF, not network sockets)
- Host kernel modules: HackRF udev rules must be installed on the host for device recognition
- Host package: `hackrf` (for udev rules and firmware utilities)

### Docker-to-Host Communication

- HackRF One must be physically connected to the host and accessible via USB passthrough
- Host requires HackRF udev rules: `/etc/udev/rules.d/53-hackrf.rules`
- No network port mappings required; all RF operations are performed through USB-connected HackRF hardware
- Container isolation does NOT contain RF emissions; once transmitting, all devices within radio range are affected

## Install Instructions (Docker on Kali RPi 5)

### Host Preparation

```bash
# Install HackRF udev rules on host
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y hackrf
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# Verify HackRF detected
hackrf_info
```

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM debian:bookworm-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    git \
    gnuradio \
    gr-osmosdr \
    hackrf \
    libhackrf-dev \
    python3 \
    python3-numpy \
    python3-scipy \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN git clone https://github.com/tiiuae/jamrf.git /opt/jamrf

WORKDIR /opt/jamrf

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
```

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t argos/jamrf .

# Run with HackRF passthrough
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  argos/jamrf

# Run jamRF v1 (proactive/reactive jamming)
# python3 jamRF_v1.py --config config.yaml
# Run jamRF v2 (extended with QPSK, energy-saving)
# python3 jamRF_v2.py --config config.yaml
```

## Kali Linux Raspberry Pi 5 Compatibility

### Architecture Support

**ARM64 NATIVE** - JamRF is a Python application using GNU Radio, which is available in Kali ARM64 repositories. GNU Radio, gr-osmosdr, and HackRF libraries all compile and run natively on aarch64. No architecture-specific binary dependencies.

### Hardware Constraints

- CPU: GNU Radio signal processing is moderately CPU-intensive; Cortex-A76 quad-core handles single-band jamming waveform generation adequately
- RAM: ~512MB-1GB during active GNU Radio flowgraph execution; well within 8GB available
- Hardware: Requires HackRF One (installed). HackRF TX power is limited to ~15 dBm; effective jamming radius is constrained without external amplification. Single HackRF can cover ~20 MHz instantaneous bandwidth
- Storage: Minimal (<500MB including GNU Radio dependencies in Docker)

### Verdict

**COMPATIBLE** - The GNU Radio + HackRF stack runs natively on Kali RPi 5 ARM64 and all dependencies are available in Kali ARM64 repositories. Repository contains working Python scripts (jamRF_v1.py, jamRF_v2.py) with YAML configuration. Primary limitation is HackRF transmit power (~15 dBm) and bandwidth (~20 MHz), not platform constraints.
