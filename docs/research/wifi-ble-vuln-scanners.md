## Tier 1 — Established, Actively Maintained, Closest to the Vision

### 1. Bettercap (WiFi + BLE + Network)

- **URL**: <https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap>
- **Stars**: 19,006 | **Language**: Go | **Last pushed**: 2026-03-29
- **What it does**: Swiss Army knife for 802.11, BLE, HID, IPv4/IPv6 recon and MITM. WiFi deauth, PMKID capture, rogue AP, BLE device enumeration, BLE GATT read/write, network sniffing.
- **GUI**: Yes — official web UI at <https://github.com/bettercap/ui> (362 stars, TypeScript). Real-time dashboard showing discovered WiFi APs, BLE devices, network hosts.
- **Wraps**: Standalone (Go binary). Does NOT wrap aircrack-ng — has its own 802.11 and BLE stacks.
- **RPi/ARM**: Yes, native ARM builds. Already in Argos Docker compose.
- **Verdict**: **BEST OVERALL MATCH**. Covers both WiFi and BLE with a web UI. The UI is basic but functional. This is the closest thing to "Burp for wireless" that exists today. You already run it.

## Gap Analysis

**The "Burp Suite for WiFi/BLE" does not exist yet.** Here is what is missing:

| Feature                           | Best Current Tool | Gap                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| WiFi AP vulnerability scanning    | Airgeddon (CLI)   | No web UI, no structured vuln reports    |
| BLE device vulnerability scanning | BlueToolkit       | Jupyter-only, BT Classic not BLE         |
| Combined WiFi + BLE in one UI     | Bettercap + UI    | UI is basic, no vuln assessment workflow |
| Automated vuln assessment         | Wifite2           | Just cracks passwords, no vuln taxonomy  |
| Web dashboard for results         | Kismet            | Passive only, no active scanning         |
| AI-powered analysis               | Pwnagotchi        | Only optimizes handshake capture         |
| PMKID/KRACK/deauth testing        | Airgeddon         | No structured "scan and report" mode     |
| BLE GATT enumeration + vulns      | Bettercap         | Can enumerate but no vuln database       |

**Opportunity**: A tool that combines:

1. Bettercap's WiFi+BLE recon engine
2. Airgeddon's attack coverage (PMKID, KRACK, deauth, WPS, evil twin)
3. BlueToolkit's BT vulnerability database
4. Kismet's web UI quality
5. Structured vulnerability reporting (like Burp's issue definitions)

This is precisely the gap that could be filled by an Argos module.

## Recommendations for Argos Integration

**Immediate (already have)**:

- Bettercap (Docker) — already in your stack. Its web UI at port 80 gives WiFi + BLE recon.
- Kismet — already integrated. Passive WiFi/BLE monitoring.

**Short-term additions**:

- BlueToolkit — pip install, run BT Classic vuln scans from Argos API
- Airgeddon — already available on Kali, wrap key functions via exec

**Build opportunity**:

- Create an Argos "Wireless Vuln Scanner" view that orchestrates bettercap (recon) + targeted tests (PMKID check, deauth susceptibility, BLE GATT enum) with structured reporting
- This would be the first web-UI-based WiFi+BLE vulnerability assessment dashboard
