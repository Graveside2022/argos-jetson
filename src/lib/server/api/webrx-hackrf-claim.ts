/**
 * HackRF resource-claim helpers for WebRX-family control endpoints.
 *
 * Both OpenWebRX and NovaSDR drive the same HackRF One via Docker containers.
 * This module wraps ResourceManager.acquire()/release() with peer-aware
 * recovery semantics appropriate for WebSDR start/stop flows:
 *
 *   - If the HackRF is owned by the SIBLING WebSDR (openwebrx ⇄ novasdr),
 *     the caller auto-recovers by force-releasing the peer container and
 *     retrying acquire(). This preserves the soft-interlock UX from the
 *     original NovaSDR integration: clicking Start on NovaSDR while
 *     OpenWebRX is running Just Works.
 *
 *   - If the HackRF is owned by ANY OTHER tool (e.g. gsm-evil, kismet,
 *     pagermon), the helper REFUSES to start and returns a structured
 *     conflict error. The operator must manually stop the conflicting tool.
 *     This prevents silently crashing an in-progress IMSI capture or
 *     wardrive when a user casually clicks Start on a WebSDR.
 *
 * Pattern adapted from
 * src/lib/server/services/gsm-evil/gsm-evil-control-helpers.ts which uses
 * an identical recover-and-retry flow for native GSM processes.
